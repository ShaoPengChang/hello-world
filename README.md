# hello-world

Hello people to whom this may concern,

I'm Shao-Peng Chang. Just stopped by to say hi and learn how to use Github.

I'm currently a mechanical engineering student, but I've been wanting to switch into software engineering for some time now. However, I just found out this morning that my faculty transfer has been refused :(. Nontheless, I will not let this slight inconvinience deter me from pursuing knowledge and excellence in this field.

I look forward to contributing.
